# For a poor man's static archival deployment with relative links,
# change baseurl to ".", uncomment permalink, and suffix collections > dec2bin > permalink with ".html".
# Note that in-article relative links won't work and videos won't properly embed when opening via "file:///.

# Example of an FTP deployment (copy generated files in _site/ to public_html/dec2bin):
# baseurl: "/~schaad/dec2bin"
# url: "http://web.media.mit.edu"

# Example of a GH Pages deployment (sources pushed to repo "dec2bin", branch "gh-pages"):
# baseurl: "/dec2bin"
# url: "https://quickutils.github.io"
